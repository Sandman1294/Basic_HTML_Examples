<p>  In the fall of 2011, our university conducted a survey to find out why students had
come to this college.  After intensive efforts to collect data from students, data was then
collated by Smythe University's Center for Research.  Researchers gave a presentation
to the President of the College, the College Board and local news organizations to provide
information about the results of the work. </p>

One of the first questions concerned the manner in which the data was collected from students.
Researchers summarized the data collection methods, highlighting the following: <br />

<ul>
<li>over 5,200 students were surveyed.</li>
<li>surveys were distributed in all Freshman Seinar classes.</Li>
<li>researchers also conducted one-on-one interviews with many students.</li>
<li>no students refused to participate when asked for information.</li>
<li>funding for the survey came from a federal grant for institutional research.</li>
</ul>
<br />

One of the first pieces of information tabulated by S.U.'s Center for Research concerned
the key reasons that students indicated that they had come to college.  Based on frequency
of response, the following were the top five reasons students indicated they came to college
at Smythe University:<br />
<ol>
<li>because the college had a good reputation.</li>
<li>to experience student activities outside the classroom.</li>
<li>to make money after graduating.</li>
<li>to get a personally fulfilling job.</li>
<li>to prepare for higher level degrees.</li>
</ol>
<br />
