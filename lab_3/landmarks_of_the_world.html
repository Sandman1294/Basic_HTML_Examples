	The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of stone,
	brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials, generally built along 
	an east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of China in 
	part to protect the Chinese Empire or its prototypical states against intrusions 
	by various nomadic groups or military incursions by various warlike peoples 
	or forces. Several walls were being built as early as the 7th century BC;
	these, later joined together and made bigger, stronger, and unified are now 
	collectively referred to as the Great Wall. Especially famous is the wall built 
	between 220-206 BC by the first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang. Little of 
	that wall remains. Since then, the Great Wall has on and off been rebuilt, 
	maintained, and enhanced; the majority of the existing wall was reconstructed 
	during the Ming Dynasty. <sub>Wikipedia</sub>

	The Sydney Opera House is a multi-venue performing arts centre in Sydney,
	New South Wales, Australia. It was conceived and largely built by Danish 
	architect Jorn Utzon, opening in 1973 after a long gestation that began with
	his competition-winning design in 1957.<sub>Wikipedia</sub>
